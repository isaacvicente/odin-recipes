## Odin Recipes!

As we all know, Odin was a viking. As such, nothing better than
some viking recipes that Odin himself would love.

This simple site was created in order to practice the basics
of HTML I learned in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). You can see the project assignment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

By the way, this was my first project.

All the recipes I used you can find [here](https://www.ribevikingecenter.dk/en/learn-more/viking-slow-food/recipes.aspx).
