    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Vikings in and around Ribe had quick access to the Wadden Sea, and so fish and shellfish were an important
      supplement to the diet and a great source of protein.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>5 carrots</li>
      <li>5 medium sized onions</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Water ca. 1.5 litre</li>
      <li>Chervil</li>
      <li>Cress</li>
      <li>1 cup cream</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>750g of cleaned fish, eg., salmon or trout</li>
      <li>Finely chopped top of spring onion</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Clean and dice the onions and carrots. Rinse the herbs and chop medium fine.
      </li>
      <li>
	Melt the butter in a cooking pot. Add the onions and carrots and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the water and bring
